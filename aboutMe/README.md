## Intro
Hey! :smile: <br>
I'm Sanda and I'm in my 3rd, exploring the embedded systems and computer architecture pathway within ECE. Even though this class is a requirement core class, I am looking forward in learning how to program arduino, soldering PCB, and designing a 3 D printed object! <br>

## Funfact
In my free time, I love to do activities involving anything "outdoorsy" including hiking :mountain: , camping :tent: , and spikeball. <br>
